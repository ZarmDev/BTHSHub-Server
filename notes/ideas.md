## Client:
- On the first startup, show the freshman guide. There is a google doc of things you wrote for freshmen. Then, tell them also about NHS tutoring and afterschool tutoring. 
- Finally, show check marks for interests like band, orchestra, sci Olympiad, robotics, track and then based on that show a guide and steps for freshmen. 
- Add a checklist for each year and what you should be doing (also add the college google classroom stuff)
- A way for Brooklyn Tech coaches to add data to create teams (like SportsYou) except it immediately shows every team and the tryouts and discussions
- It gives you notifications for tryouts and includes the daily announcement which can be updated by visiting the website
- Discord-like way to chat about college and other stuff. Also automatic NHS pairing/senior buddy pairing with ability to text them.
- There will also be guides like the locker policy, the requirements for gyms/clubs/advanced diplomas, how to tryout for science Olympiad, how to get into robotics (be charismatic/leader), people's advice, comments (If time permit) and this huge guide/youtube video: BTHS GUIDE VIDEO - Google Docs
- Contains a way to view the directory for clubs and teachers
- Contains a way to share schedules with other students (if time permits) and a calendar like Saturn
- Add discussion groups for classes that you can join using a code or just freely join but ensure that teachers CANNOT join it. Allow users to be anonymous but also allow a moderator who can perma ban accounts
- Add a group called proposals, crushes, confessions and moderators. Proposals is where you can vote like reddit on proposals to do
- Add discussions/guides part of the site and course discussions/FAQ. I think the best way is if we had a google classroom like UI which has different groups (not to be confused with teams) that had all the courses listed, the teachers there and FAQs about it
- Add events
- Add a teacher appreciation part where you can nominate teachers and they get awards
Reminders:
- Each month after Junior year Februrary, you will get reminders about college like the college checklist
- Every summer, you will get a reminder about summer reading
- Add a custom data logger for track athletes that times it and automatically logs it in a nice format
